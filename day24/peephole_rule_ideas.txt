after pruning, apply peephole rules:
    initialize value directly
        mul x 0
        add x 25
        add x 1
    commutative addition, sum directly
        mul x 0
        add x 5
        add x y
        add z x
    clear register + move but original went unused, should have just used original
        mul x 0
        add x w
        < w is unused >
